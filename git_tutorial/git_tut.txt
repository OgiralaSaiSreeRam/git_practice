GIT is basically to track changes, of any kind. That is why even if you delete a committed file it asks you put it in stage area for commit.


git status
git add .   ---> to add all the files in the cwd to the stage are.
Stage are ---> The area where all the changes made will be reflected/shown in the commit history. When a commit is performed only the files added with the current changes to the stage area will be committed.
Even if a change is made to the file which is in the stage area, before the commit if the new changes are not added to the stage it will not be shown in the commit.

git restore --staged filename.txt   ---> will remove the file from the stage area but will show it in modified changes section.
git stash ---> all the changes that have been added to the stage area can be stashed so that any commits now made will not have the present changes in the stash. The changes in stash can be retrieved later.
git stash pop ---> to retrieve those changes.
commit is like a photo. You can go back to that point in time.
