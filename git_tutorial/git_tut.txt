GIT is basically to track changes, of any kind. That is why even if you delete a committed file it asks you put it in stage area for commit.


git status
git add .   ---> to add all the files in the cwd to the stage are.
Stage are ---> The area where all the changes made will be reflected/shown in the commit history. When a commit is performed only the files added with the current changes to the stage area will be committed.
Even if a change is made to the file which is in the stage area, before the commit if the new changes are not added to the stage it will not be shown in the commit.

git restore --staged filename.txt   ---> will remove the file from the stage area but will show it in modified changes section.
git stash ---> all the changes that have been added to the stage area can be stashed so that any commits now made will not have the present changes in the stash. The changes in stash can be retrieved later.

--------------------something that happened while testing stash----------------
made changes and stashed the file. But made changes to the current file not in stash and commited it and then later popped the stash.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
git stash pop ---> to retrieve those changes.
=======

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
commit is like a photo. You can go back to that point in time.
---------------------------------------------------
git stash clear ---> to clear the changes in the stash

git remote add origin <<url>>  ---> for connecting with the remote repository and local. By convention its known as origin but you can use any name.

git push <origin> <main>  ---> to push all your commits  to remote. which remote repo-name:origin, which branch-name:main.
